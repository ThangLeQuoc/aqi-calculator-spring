# Spring Boot AQI Calculator

The [Java AQI Calculator](https://github.com/ThangLeQuoc/aqi-calculator) as the REST API Spring Boot application to make it easy to start and run.

# Installation
Checkout the code  
Inside the project root, run
>./gradlew bootRun


# For Docker user (strongly recommended)
Fear of Java, Spring Boot, or maybe you're just too lazy to install them.  
With [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), it's super easy to get the container up and running without installing Java on your local machine. You don't need to know Java or Spring  
Give it a go:  
> docker pull thanglequoc/aqi-calculator-spring-boot:latest

The container application port is **8080**, you will need to [map your host port to the port](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/) **8080** of the container

Run the container with a specified port on your machine (e.g: 8080) to the application port **8080**
> docker run --name=aqi-calculator -p 8080:8080 thanglequoc/aqi-calculator-spring-boot

**Response**
```json
{
    "pollutant": "PM25",
    "concentration": 66.6,
    "category": "Unhealthy",
    "color": "Red",
    "meaning": "Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects",
    "healthEffectsStatements": "Increased aggravation of respiratory symptoms in sensitive groups including older adults, children, and people of lower socioeconomic status; increased aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in people with heart or lung disease; increased respiratory effects in general population",
    "cautionaryStatements": "People with heart or lung disease, older adults, children, and people of lower socioeconomic status should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion; everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion",
    "sensitiveGroups": "People with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly and children are the groups most at risk",
    "aqi": 157
}
```

The `aqi` in the response is the Nowcast AQI

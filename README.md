# Spring Boot AQI Calculator

The [Java AQI Calculator](https://github.com/ThangLeQuoc/aqi-calculator) as the Spring Boot application to make it easy to start and run.

# Installation
Checkout the code  
Inside the project root, run
>./gradlew bootRun


# For Docker user (strongly recommended)
Fear of Java, Spring Boot, or maybe you're just too lazy to install them.  
With [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), it's super easy to get the container up and running without installing Java on your local machine. You don't need to know Java or Spring  
Give it a go:  
> docker pull thanglequoc/aqi-calculator-spring-boot:latest

The container application port is *8080*, you will need to [map your host port to the port](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/) *8080* of the container

Run the container with a specified port on your machine (e.g: 8080) to the application port **8080**
> docker run --name=aqi-calculator -p 8080:8080 thanglequoc/aqi-calculator-spring-boot

# Usage
